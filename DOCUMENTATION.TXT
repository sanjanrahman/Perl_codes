SOME USEFUL TIPS:
Note : All these assume your current directory is alma:

1) How to run validation of all xmls generated manually? 
Execute the below command and if it displays nothing then the xml is valid. It will display if any mismatch found.
xmllint --noout --schema files/xsd/external_sys_user.xsd files/xmls/*.xml 2>&1 | grep -v "validates"

2) How do I test if the cron is working fine?
Make sure cron.sh is set to run using "crontab -l" command.
Then execute "bash cron.sh"

3) How to start debuggin the code?
Often the best way to start is to look at the log files located at alma/files/logs of both the scripts.

WORKFLOW of cron.sh:
1) We get feeds from HR department every day and the files are placed in alma/import .
2) lp_new.pl reads the files from alma/import and generates an intermediate file at alma/files/intermediate. This script has all the priorites for various fields of each person.
3) generate_xml.pl reads the yesterday's and today's intermediate file from alma/files/intermediate and generates the final xml files in alma/files/xmls.
4) Move the yesterday's zip file to the alma/files/archives directory.
5) Zip all the xmls from alma/files/xmls and create the file upload_today.zip.
6) Upload to the IR server using ssh.
